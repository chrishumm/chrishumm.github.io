Are you bored in quarantine?
I'm not.
There's plenty to do!
I purchased the [Guillow's kit model 301LC](https://www.guillow.com/aeroncachampion.aspx), a laser-cut kit of an Aeronca Champion 85.
It even flew better than my previous rubber band powered models in the past.

It was super easy to build!
When I built Guillow's kits years ago, the die-cut parts were largely inconsistent.
The laser-cut pieces were cut out very quickly, and each one was perfect.
This was so much more fun than in the past because there was so much less stress.

I find that the best glue for these models is a white glue with wood glue when necessary.

I covered it with the included tissue paper.
I chose not to paint it because I had no model paint on hand, and craft stores are closed due to COVID.
All tissue is sealed with a single layer of spray-can butyrate dope.
I can no longer find it anywhere, which is a shame.
It was always my go to.
