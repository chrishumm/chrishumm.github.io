I attended [North East Database Day 2020](http://mitdbg.github.io/nedbday/2020/) on January 27, 2020 at MIT.
Moreover, I presented a poster *WimPi: Data Analytics on a "Wimpy" Cluster*.
I particularly enjoyed the talk *AI Data Wrangling with Associative Arrays* by Jeremy Kepner of the MIT Lincoln Laboratory.
What a great reminder that databases have such a mathematical underpinning!
