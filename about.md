>“Nothing compares to the simple pleasure of riding a bike.” <cite>― John F. Kennedy ―</cite>

Hello!
My name is Connor Lucket.
I am a third-year Ph.D. student studying [Computer Science at Brown University](https://cs.brown.edu/), working with the [Brown Database Group](https://brownbigdata.github.io/).
I am now a doctoral *candidate*, and my next step is to propose a thesis.
I am currently looking at how to make GDPR-compliace easier for smaller enterprises (ICDE '21).
Previously, I considered how wimpy clusters could potentially be used to save energy for data processing (ICDE '21).

I completed my undergraduate studies at [Austin College in Sherman, TX](https://www.austincollege.edu/) with a double major in computer science and mathematics and a minor in physics.
Surprisingly, I started with physics and found I enjoyed the math courses more.
After taking my required C.S. course for my math degree, I fell in love, and the rest is history.

I love bicycles, airplanes, and music.
I'm currently building a Thatcher CX4, which is a single-seat aluminum airplane built from plans and powered by a converted VW Beetle engine.
The build's site can be accessed from the sidebar.
Also, my cat's name is Sir Isaac Newton.
