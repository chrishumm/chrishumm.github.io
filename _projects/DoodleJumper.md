This is Doodle Jumper! (Creative name, right?). It is a Doodle Jump clone written for Android and iOS.
The game is written in C++ and uses the cocos2dx library, which can be used to port to other platforms.

The aim of the game is to keep going higher. You need to use your mobiles accelerometer to control the character. Position yourself to land on the platforms and be careful! Some platforms will break and you need to time your jumps correctly.

It is currently an alpha, so expect some quirks.

You can view the [code](https://github.com/chrishumm/DoodleJumper) over on my [Github :)](https://www.github.com/chrishumm)
Or download it and have a play!
