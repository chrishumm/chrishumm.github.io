This is a collection of small programs written in Python. I am still actively working on them and will add to them continuously as I play and experiment with different things.

I am currently working on a Quiz Game. It uses tk to draw the GUI and is a time-based time testing your knowledge with random trivia questions! 

You can view the [code](https://github.com/chrishumm/PythonProjects) over on my [Github :)](https://www.github.com/chrishumm)
Or download it and play around yourself!
