This is a GUI application written in Python that tracks the ISS above the Earth.
I connect to the ISS real time using APIs and draw the position over an image drawn in Python Turtle package.

It also displays the current astronauts on board the ISS.

You can view the [code](https://github.com/chrishumm/twitter-bots) over on my [Github :)](https://www.github.com/chrishumm)
Or download it and have a play!
