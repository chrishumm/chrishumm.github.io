Ever just wanted to stop an exe from running in the background without a fuss? That's what I wanted. I created this simple exe blocker that will automatically close any exes that match the program you wish to block and stop them running in memory.

It is currently an alpha, so expect some quirks.

You can view the [code](https://github.com/chrishumm/ExeBlocker) over on my [Github :)](https://www.github.com/chrishumm)
Or download it and have a play!
