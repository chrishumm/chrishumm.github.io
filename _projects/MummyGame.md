This is a simple game you can run in the command line on your Windows computer. The goal of the game is to get to the end of the stage, but you must first collect all the candy bars scattered randomly around the level.

You have a limited number of spades in your inventory that can be used to dig and trap enemies.

It is currently an alpha, so expect some quirks.

You can view the [code](https://github.com/chrishumm/MummyGame) over on my [Github :)](https://www.github.com/chrishumm)
Or download it and have a play!
